A machine learning web application that predicts whether a person is at risk of diabetes based on key health indicators. Built with Python, trained in Google Colab.
📊 Overview
This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to build a classification model that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes. The model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier and evaluated with accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix.

✅ Features
Complete machine learning pipeline from data loading to prediction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Model training with RandomForestClassifier

Feature importance visualization to understand key predictors

Trained model saved using pickle for future deployment

📁 Dataset
Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Records: 768 patient entries

Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age

Target: Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

📈 Model Performance
Accuracy: ~72%

Confusion Matrix and classification report used for detailed evaluation

Balanced performance across both classes
